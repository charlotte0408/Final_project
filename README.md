# Final Project(GAME 20148) Learning Process

My final project is the algorithm implementation of game 2048 in both console and qt environment.
The following contains the description and what I learn from this project. 

##  Description and Code 
*   [Description of my final project][description]

*   [CORE algorithm (QT version)][core] 
*   [GUI algorithm in QT][gui]

##  What I gain from this Project 

* During this project, I developed my **GUI programming skills(qt)**, learned about **subject-observer pattern**, and also improved my **debugging skills**. More importantly, I gained first-hand experiences about the **whole developing process of a software program**.

## Specifically I learned from these two parts separately 
### Console part
* Overall, during the core algorithm implementation, I learned to start designing a game from a scratch paper, including how to break seemingly complex function into different small functions. 
* Moreover, I reviewed the random number generation function. 
* More importantly, I stuck a really long time on debugging and it was the first time that I realized that programming is largely about debugging. 
* Therefore, I developed a lot of **debugging skills**, including adding “cout” after steps so that I could learn about the internal states. 
* Actually, the implementation is a process that **combines all of my previous knowledge from pic 10A and 10B**. Before, I gained enough tools that were needed for this implementation. After this program, I learned how to **apply** this tools to “real-world” problems and to use them in a more **wholesome** way. 
### QT part 
* Overall, I learned how to **adapt** C++ algorithm to a QT environment by using core and algorithm separately. 
* Moreover, I learned more about the **QT languages** by looking through QT documents, including QVector, QWidget, QGridLayout class. 
* Most importantly, I learned a concept called **Subject-Observer pattern**, which is an important pattern in object-oriented programming languages.
