# QT_GUI Implementation 

* This is the GUI implementation process of my project. 
* My codes are divided into two parts in QT, core and gui versions. 

## Learning process for QT_GUI part 
* **QTile** class is inherited both from the Tile class and the QLabel class because after reading the links, I figured out that QLabel class is the most suitable one

    Moreover, I gained ideas about how to change colors of these tiles, but they were still not working. However, I decided to first implement other parts and then go back to fix the error.

* Starting to implement the **QGamebaord** class, **STUCK** for really a long time because I cannot find the logic in my implementation
    * Every time I move the board, several checks should be done at the same time, including whether it is full, the player has won, or just draw the board again. 
    * Thinking about the implementing in the main function, but as it is a QT project, the main function should also deal with the window->show thing, and I donâ€™t want to mess my algorithms up. 
    * Also, I remembered earlier that my pic 10b professor said that the advanced version of programming is to implement almost everything in class, but not in the main function. 
    * So I searched online for ways to implement and also asked TA for help. 
    * **Finally**, I figured out that I could implement my project with Observer and Subject pattern, which allowed me to deal with the one-to-many dependency relation. Following are the links that TA suggested or I searched online.

    I added two more classes for this patter, subject and observer.
